# DynaMol

THIS IS IN VERY EARLY ALPHA

A non professional-grade MD simulator. 

With this project I strive to create an interactible tool to visualise the typically theoretical and equation-oriented world of microscale chemistry. 
This tool should NOT be used to create professional reliable data, its just for fun and I in no way put my focus on reliable accuracy. Nonetheless it could definetely be used
as a learning tool, haveeee fuuuuunnnnnnnn

NOTE: I suck at computers so Ill add that python should be installed as well as the numpy and pygame libraries. This can be done in the command prompt as follows:

install python

pip install numpy

pip install pygame
